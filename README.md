# MAGD-150-Assignments

## Project 1

For this first project, we simply created a sketch using basic tools such as line, rectangle, and ellipse, and colored it in black and white.
[I created an image of a person outside at night, witha building and the moon near him.](https://github.com/egnenich/MAGD-150-Assignments/edit/master/AssignmentOne.pde)

## Project 2

This project introduced color as well as the ability to create unique shapes.

[I created an image of the Earth, along with the sun and the moon in the background.]()

## Project 3

This project introduced concepts of printing lines, and using key words such as mouseX, mouseY, previous mouse x, previous max y, frame count, width, height. It also introduced math oporators, functions such as maximum, minimum, constrain, map, distance, and linear interpolation. 

[For this project, I made a screensaver that contains a rectangle that consistently changes color, that the user can move with thier mouse, and notifies if the user is "away" and for how long they've been "away"]()

## Project 4

This project required either animation or movement, responded to user interaction (mouse and keyboard) and used three conditionals, as well as one "loop"

[I created a circle that expands to a certain radius, then goes back to it's original size, only to expand, repeatedly. The circle can change color when any key is pressed, adn the background will change shades of grey if the mouse is pressed.]()

## Project 5

This project introduced concepts such as buttons that respond when clicked on, and events occuring as they are pressed, and labels each button as well.

[I created a television and remote, where the television needs to be on (press power button) first, and then user can change channels by pressing any of the other buttons on the remote, and the television will react accordingly.]()
